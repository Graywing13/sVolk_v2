sVOLK REMIX
===========
Graywing13's First Project
--------------------------
I am making this sVolk project because I wanted to have some practice using **Java** while satisfying my fangirlness of Volk in Dragalia Lost (of Nintendo and Cygames).

This is the second version of sVolk. In the first version, I used a scanner to parse text files that were turned into dictionaries; 
in this version, I will be adding the graphics via in Swing.  

Reminders
---------
### Order of Code:
1. Import Statements
2. Class Declaration
3. Constants then Fields (where constants have the keywords "static" and "final" and are in all caps and underscores)
4. Constructor
5. Public and Private Methods
